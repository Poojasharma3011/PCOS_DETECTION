Overview
The PCOS Prediction System is a web-based application that helps predict the likelihood of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) based on user inputs. It uses machine learning to analyze various health parameters and provide a prediction. The system is built using React.js for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and Flask for web integration.

Features
✅ User-friendly web interface to input health data
✅ Machine learning model to predict PCOS
✅ Uses FastAPI for real-time predictions
✅ Interactive frontend using React.js
✅ Supports Flask for server-side rendering
